## Interests
- I have a passion for the world of Open Source and contributing to open-source projects.
- Due to my interest in cybersecurity and Bug Bounty, I enjoy conducting security testing of websites, finding vulnerabilities, and reporting them.

If you have any questions or want to discuss collaboration or joint projects, please feel free to get in touch.
